# Java_Work

**Overview**

Welcome to my connect 4 Java Project repository. This project is a connect 4 based game, developed during my Software Engineering class, showcases the ability to apply industry-standard coding techniques and principles. I was apart a team with 3 other collaborators in charge of creating a sound, customizable, and reusable game/code in Java over the semester.

**Key Features**

Customizable Game Settings - Players can select from a range of board sizes and number to win lengths, leading to more customization for the user.

Java Based - Developed purely in Java using console-based gaming (no JavaFX or GUI).

Coding Techniques - Implements contracts, coding to the interface, seperation of concerns, encapsulation, and other various coding practices to ensure a sound, readable program.

Testing - Extensively tested using JUnit to ensure reliability and stability of the code.


**Installation and Setup**
